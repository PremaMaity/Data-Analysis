Step By Step Exploratory Data Analysis Of Titanic DataSet and building model
Exploratory data analysis is one of the most important step for any data science project. Here we will do the data analysis of titanic dataset
we have 11 features using which we shall predict the target variable which is ‘Survived’
Data Preprocessong, EDA using seaborn library,Matplotlib and making charts and doing univariate and bivariate analysis
